# TEFG
Temporary Events Frequency Generator

The goal of the project we propose and which we have called T.E.F.G (Temporary Event Frequency Generator), is to apply data analysis techniques in a semi-automatic way, so they can be use by users who are not necessarily experts on the matter. Moreover, we want this project to be able to quickly deal with a huge amount of information, generating visual representations and brief reports that allow to catch at a glance an event resume that use to be composed of thousands of messages.


T.E.F.G can also be useful for companies, because is not new that nowadays information can be translated into economic profits. With our tool, companies can know better their clientâ€™s interests and offer their products based on those.


In particular, T.E.F.G goals are:
    
    Summarize in a graphic way an event on Twitter. The graphic must show the tweets frequencies at every moment since we assume that the most relevant moments correspond to the highest frequency peaks.

    Furthermore, for each frequency peak, or in general, for every interval selected by the user, we want to be capable to offer the most significant tweets that summarize the information within the interval.

    Making use of the previous point and applying it to an event, we want to build a timeline with the most significant tweets that best summarize the event.
